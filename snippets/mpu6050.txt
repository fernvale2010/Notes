Calculations

Note that gyroscope and accelerometer sensor data of MPU6050 module consists of 16-bit raw data in 2’s complement form.

Temperature sensor data of MPU6050 module consists of 16-bit data (not in 2’s complement form).

Now suppose we have selected,

-  Accelerometer full scale range of +/- 2g with Sensitivity Scale Factor of 16,384 LSB(Count)/g.

-  Gyroscope full scale range of +/- 250 °/s with Sensitivity Scale Factor of 131 LSB (Count)/°/s.

then,

To get sensor raw data, we need to first perform 2’s complement on sensor data of Accelerometer and gyroscope.

After getting sensor raw data we can calculate acceleration and angular velocity by dividing sensor raw data with their 
sensitivity scale factor as follows,

Accelerometer values in g (g force)

Acceleration along the X axis = (Accelerometer X axis raw data/16384) g.

Acceleration along the Y axis = (Accelerometer Y axis raw data/16384) g.

Acceleration along the Z axis = (Accelerometer Z axis raw data/16384) g.

Gyroscope values in °/s (degree per second)

Angular velocity along the X axis = (Gyroscope X axis raw data/131) °/s.

Angular velocity along the Y axis = (Gyroscope Y axis raw data/131) °/s.

Angular velocity along the Z axis = (Gyroscope Z axis raw data/131) °/s.

Temperature value in °/c (degree per Celsius)

Temperature in degrees C = ((temperature sensor data)/340 + 36.53) °/c.

For example,

Suppose, after 2’ complement we get accelerometer X axes raw value = +15454

Then Ax = +15454/16384 = 0.94 g.
