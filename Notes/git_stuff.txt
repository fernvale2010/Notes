--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You push your local repository to the remote repository using the git push command after first 
establishing a relationship between the two with the git remote add [alias] [url] command. 
If you visit your Github repository, it will show you the URL to use for pushing. You'll first enter 
something like:

  git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git

Unless you started by running git clone against the remote repository, in which case this step has 
been done for you already.

And after that, you'll type:

  git push origin master

After your first push, you can simply type:

  git push

when you want to update the remote repository in the future.

My steps:
- create a folder in PC, 
  e.g. c:\work

- run git-bash.exe and cd to folder, e.g.
  cd /c/work

- copy files to folder

- in git-bash, run
  git init

- add the files in folder to repo
  git add .

- commit
  git commit -m "first commit"  <== "first commit" is the commit comment

- check what branch we are in:
  git branch  <== show show which branch, if no branches created, then default is master  
  * master 
  OR
  git status
  On branch master  <== show this

- push to git repo
  $ git push https://github.com/fernvale2010/Notes.git master

  To https://github.com/fernvale2010/Notes.git
   * [new branch]      master -> master

To Clone a repo:
- create a folder, e.g.
  c:\workTemp

- cd into c:\workTemp

- git init  <== maybe not needed

- git clone https://github.com/fernvale2010/Notes.git
  A Notes folder is created in c:\workTemp, with the repo files cloned..

- cd into Notes folder

- Can checkout/create new branches, etc
  git checkout -b new_branch

- Make changes, add new files, and do the:
  git add .
  git commit -m "whatever comments for the changes"
  git push origin master
